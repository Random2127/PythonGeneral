### This is a folder with random Python stuff I come across or I'm just curious about. 

The folder "littleThings" will just have tests and usage of modules or practicing syntax. 

YTDownloader.py:
Learning how to work with "yt_dlp" just a few tests to gather metadata, videos and audio.
Still need to work on it, i'll be noting down what I want to do and keep doing.
~~- Made a basic console menu. ~~
- Need to look into metadata which I would normally like to know
- Read quality of videos and give the choice of which to download
- Take the path where I'd like to save the file
- Make a GUI for this in Â¿React?
