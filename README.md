### This is a folder with random Python stuff I come across or I'm just curious about. 

The folder "littleThings" will just have tests and usage of modules or practicing syntax. 

YTDownloader.py:
Learning how to work with "yt_dlp" just a few tests to gather metadata, videos and audio.
Still need to work on it. I'll make a menu for it, need to think about how I want it.
